# API Project using Go and GORM

This is the second assignment for the KoinWorks-Hacktiv8's Scalable Web Service with Golang course. On this assignment, I created a CRUD server using Go and GORM connected with API.

### Initialization
```bash
go mod tidy

go mod vendor
```

### Running the App
```bash
go run main.go
```

### Using the API
API documentation can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12684048/UVkiTJuC).
